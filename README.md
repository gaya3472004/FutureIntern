This repository contains several Java programs that demonstrate core concepts like arithmetic calculations, game development, and password generation. Below are the descriptions of each project in this repository:

---

## Task1. **Multitype Calculator**

A console-based Java application that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on different data types: `Integer`, `Float`, `Double`, and `Long`. The user can choose the type of values to enter, and the program ensures that valid numbers are provided for the selected data type. After performing a calculation, the program asks the user if they want to perform additional operations or switch to another data type. This calculator offers flexibility and simplicity for users.

### Features:
- Supports `Integer`, `Float`, `Double`, and `Long` data types.
- Validates user input to ensure correctness.
- Allows users to perform multiple operations without restarting.
- Provides the option to choose between different data types for calculations.

## Task3. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

This is a simple console-based Java Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game uses a 3x3 grid where players alternate between `X` and `O`. After each move, the program checks if a player has won or if the game is a draw. The game continues until either a player wins or the board is full.

### Features:
- Allows two players to take turns.
- Checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- Provides an interactive, text-based user interface.
- Easy-to-understand gameplay and simple logic.

## Task5. **Random Password Generator**

This program generates secure, random passwords based on user-defined criteria. Users can specify the desired length of the password and choose which types of characters (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special symbols) to include. The program uses `SecureRandom` for high-quality randomness and ensures the generated password meets the desired complexity requirements.

### Features:
- Generates customizable passwords.
- Users can select character types to include: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Secure random password generation using `SecureRandom`.
- Allows users to specify the length of the password.
